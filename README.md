# cryptography-gui-tool

## Overview

A cryptographic tool with a GUI interface that can use keys to encrypt strings and files.

No performance optimization has been made, encrypting files larger than 1MB may cause the interface to freeze for a long time.

## Features

- Implements 11 classical ciphers, 2 stream ciphers, 2 block ciphers, 2 public key ciphers, and 1 hash algorithm. Can encrypt and decrypt both strings and files.
- Includes a GUI interface implemented with PyQt.
- The cryptographic library is separated from the GUI code and can be used as a standalone cryptographic library.

The specific implemented ciphers are as follows:

Classical Ciphers (for string encryption and decryption)

1. Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers:

* Caesar Cipher
* Keyword Cipher
* Affine Cipher
* Multilateral Cipher

2. Polyalphabetic Ciphers:

* Vigenere Cipher
* Autokey Ciphertext
* Autokey Plaintext

3. Polygram Ciphers:

* Playfair Cipher

4. Transposition Ciphers:

* Permutation Cipher
* Column Permutation Cipher
* Double-Transposition Cipher

Stream Ciphers (for encrypting and decrypting strings and files)

* RC4
* CA

Block Ciphers (for encrypting and decrypting strings and files)

* DES-64
* AES-64

Public Key Ciphers (can generate key pairs, encrypt and decrypt strings and files)

* RSA
* ECC

Hash Algorithm (for strings and files)

* MD5

## Environment Dependencies

Only PyQt5 is required, as listed in `requirement.txt`, generated by `pip freeze`.

## Deployment Steps

It is recommended to create a Python environment using `venv`. In the project directory, execute the following commands:

```shell
# 1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .env

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
# cmd
./.env/Scripts/activate.bat

# powshell
./.env/Scripts/Activate.ps1

# linux or MacOS
source ./.env/Scripts/activate
```

In the created Python environment, run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start the program
python3 main.py
```
